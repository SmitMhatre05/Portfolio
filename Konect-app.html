    <h2 class="heading">Overview</h2>
    <h3 class="paragraph">Many high school students feel unprepared when it comes to planning for post-secondary education. Back when I was in high school, several of my friends were unsure about what they actually wanted to pursue. After conducting research, we discovered some alarming statistics: 75% of high schoolers felt unprepared for post-secondary, 53% of university students had changed their major at least twice, 37% were unsure about their career path, and 30% weren’t following any path at all.
      <br><br>In a team of 5, we created KONECT, which aims to tackle this issue by helping high school students explore career-related opportunities, like competitions, seminars, info sessions, and networking events, that are tailored to their goals. While this information is scattered across the internet, KONECT curates it in one place and personalizes the experience based on each user’s location, interests, and skill level, making it easier and faster to find what’s relevant.

    <h3 class="paragraph">Initially, our target user group was people who felt lost in their careers with no specific age constraint, which were first year university students, upper-year students, and recent graduates.
      <br><br>To better understand their needs, we conducted 3 user interviews with a first year university student, an upper-year student, and a recent university graduate, and we discovered these 4 pain points:

      <div class="point">
        <h2>01</h2>
        <h2>Difficulty Connecting</h2>

        <h2>01</h2>
        <h2>MyBlueprint</h2>
        <h3>MyBlueprint is a platform widely used in Canadian high schools for university and career planning, something our team used as highschool students too. It’s helpful for things like career quizzes, course selection, and exploring post-secondary programs. However, it doesn’t do much to connect students with real-world events or mentors. The interface can also feel a bit outdated, and there’s no built-in event discovery or networking feature.

        <h2>LinkedIn</h2>
        <h3>LinkedIn is a platform we all use now in university, and it’s great for connecting with professionals, finding job postings, and staying updated on events. But for high school students, it can feel overwhelming and not very beginner-friendly. It jumps straight into a professional world without offering much guidance for those just starting out in their career exploration.
        </h3>
      </div>

      <div class="point">
        <h2>03</h2>
        <h2>Eventbrite</h2>
        <h3>Eventbrite makes it easy to find and attend local events, including ones related to careers. It has a wide variety of options and a simple search experience. However, it’s not built with students in mind; there’s no personalization, no focus on career development, and no guidance based on a student’s goals or interests.

      </div>

      <div class="point">
        <h2>04</h2>
        <h2>Guidance Counsellors</h2>
        <h3>Guidance counselors are the go-to resource for post-secondary advice in high schools. Talking to a real person can be reassuring and helpful. That said, many of my classmates in high school felt like the advice they received was often just a repeat of what’s already online. Instead of offering new insights, counselors sometimes acted more as reassurance than as a resource for discovering opportunities.
